# Spelling test revision.
A program for helping with revision for spelling tests.
Hi all, made this for my daughter. The idea being that she can have a play with some code as well as learning her weekly spellings.

You will need to install gtts & playsound via pip (the python package manager)

To get the program to work just replace the contents of the 'weeks_words' array with your words save it and then run the program.

This was fun to make and i hope you get something out of it as well.
